**Project Description:**

This project involves implementing a program to add pairs of vectors of arbitrary sizes. The program is written in C, C++, or Rust and makes use of dynamic memory allocation for handling the vectors. The primary objectives are to familiarize students with low-level programming and memory management.

**Functionality:**

The program reads a specified number of pairs of vectors from standard input, computes their pairwise sums, and outputs the results. Each vector is dynamically allocated on the heap, and all allocated memory is released before the program terminates.

**Example:**

1 2 3 4 5

6 7 8 9 10

**Output:**

7 9 11 13 15
